# API Events

API Events allow you to receive near-real-time notifications about key activities in the Mews POS system, such as changes to table booking status. These notifications are delivered via Webhooks.

## Getting started
To start using API Events:
  1. Read about [Webhooks](webhooks.md), see what events are supported and how the data is structured.
  2. Read about how to authenticate incoming Webhooks on our [Webhook security](wh-security.md) page.
  3. Configure your system to receive event notifications.
  4. Register your Webhook endpoints with Mews using API Operation [Create webhook endpoint](../operations/webhookendpoints.md#create-webhook-endpoint).
