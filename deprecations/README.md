# Deprecations

Deprecations are features of the API which you are discouraged from using, even though they may still be supported for a period of time for the sake of backwards compatibility.
Such features are normally deprecated because they are superseded by a better alternative. They can include object properties, entire objects or entire API operations.
The list of deprecations is as follows. Individual items are also highlighted in the [Changelog](../changelog/README.md) when they occur.
Historic deprecations that have already been discontinued may not be listed. For more information, see our [Deprecations Policy](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/open-api/staying-up-to-date/deprecations-policy).

> **Important:** We strongly advise you to review this list and if you are using any of the deprecated items in your integration, to update your implementation accordingly.

The table columns have the following meanings:

* __Feature__ - What entity or feature is being deprecated
* __Comments__ - Additional information, such as the reason for the deprecation and what the replacement is
* __Deprecated__ - The date at which the deprecation notice was given (see the [Changelog](../changelog/README.md))
* __Discontinued__ \- The date at which it is planned to discontinue support completely; a value of '-' indicates no date has been set
